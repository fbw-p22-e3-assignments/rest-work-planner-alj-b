# Work Planner

Build a REST application from scratch that could serve as a work planning service.

Business requirements:
* A worker has shifts
* A shift is 8 hours long
* A worker **never has two shifts on the same day**
* It is a 24-hour timetable 0-8, 8-16, 16-24

Tips:
Have a separate API for creating shifts and creating employees.
Use model relationships to link users and shifts.
